<h1>The best Web Series according to Aniruddha</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Web Series of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Modern Family</h3>
<p>Funny show with a lot of dark jokes, exactly my kind of comedy. Loved it mostly because of the kids in the show.</p>
<h3>The Office</h3>
<p> Another dark comedy show with one of the best ending I've ever seen in a sitcom.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn99</h3>
<p>This is more of a comfort show that I can watch whenever I have nothing else to do.</p>
